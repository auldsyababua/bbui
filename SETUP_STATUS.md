## ✅ Completed Setup

### Database Migration

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Created authProvider.ts
- ✅ Created accessControlProvider.ts
- ✅ Created login page
- ✅ Created user management pages (list, show, edit)
- ✅ Updated App.tsx with authentication routes
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

### Security Configuration
- ✅ All new users default to 'admin' role (as requested)

## 📋 Next Steps for You

### 1. Create Users
Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/thnwlykidzhrsagyjncc/auth/users) and create users for:
- Colin Aulds (colin@10netzero.com or appropriate email)
- Joel Fulford (joel@10netzero.com or appropriate email)
- Any other team members

### 2. Test the Application
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Login with one of the created users
4. Verify you can see documents
5. Check that the Users menu appears (admin only)

### 3. Deploy Considerations
- Ensure production uses HTTPS
- Keep service role key secure (never in frontend)
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Set up monitoring for failed login attempts

## 🔒 Current Permission Model

| Role   | Documents           | Users Management |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Admin  | Read, Create, Edit, Delete | Full Access |
| User   | Read Only          | View Only       |
| Viewer | Read Only          | No Access       |

**Note**: Per your request, User and Viewer have identical permissions for now.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Supabase Service Status**: https://status.supabase.com/
2. **Verify RLS is enabled**: Check in Table Editor > brain_bot_documents > RLS
3. **Check browser console**: Look for auth errors
4. **Verify environment variables**: Ensure .env has correct values
5. **Check user profile exists**: 
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```
