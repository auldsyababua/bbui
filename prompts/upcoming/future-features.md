# BBUI Future Features Roadmap

## Document Management Suite (Drag-and-Drop File Manager)

### Feature: Visual Document Management Interface
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Large (8-12 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: User Management System, FileTree Component

#### Description
Transform BBUI from a read-only document viewer into a full-featured document management system with a macOS Finder-like interface. Users will be able to perform all CRUD operations on documents through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, with changes automatically syncing to the brain-bot's vector store.

#### Key Capabilities

**1. Visual File Operations**
- Drag-and-drop files between folders to reorganize document structure
- Multi-select documents with Cmd/Ctrl+Click or shift-click
- Context menus (right-click) for quick actions
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Cmd+X/C/V for cut/copy/paste)
- Visual feedback during drag operations (ghost previews, drop zones)

**2. Full CRUD Functionality**
- **Create**: New documents and folders directly in the UI
- **Read**: Enhanced preview with inline editing capabilities  
- **Update**: In-place editing with auto-save and version tracking
- **Delete**: Soft-delete to archive (not permanent deletion)
- **Rename**: Inline renaming with path validation
- **Move**: Drag between folders or use cut/paste
- **Copy**: Duplicate documents with automatic naming ("Copy of...")

**3. Advanced Organization Features**
- Bulk operations (move/delete/tag multiple files)
- Smart folders based on tags, dates, or metadata
- Search results that can be manipulated like regular folders
- Breadcrumb navigation with drag-to-breadcrumb support
- Column view option (like macOS Finder)

**4. Vector Store Integration**
- Automatic re-indexing when documents are modified
- Batch sync operations for bulk changes
- Queue system for vector updates to prevent overload
- Visual indicators for sync status (synced/syncing/error)
- Manual "Force Re-index" option for troubleshooting

**5. Edit Modes**
- **Quick Edit**: Inline editing for small changes
- **Full Editor**: Monaco editor integration for code/markdown
- **WYSIWYG Mode**: Rich text editing for non-technical users
- **Metadata Editor**: Structured form for document properties
- **Batch Edit**: Apply changes to multiple documents

**6. Safety Features**
- Undo/Redo stack for all operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Archive instead of hard delete
- Version history with diff viewer
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Activity log showing who changed what and when

#### Technical Implementation

**Frontend Components**
- `DraggableFileTree`: React DnD-based tree component
- `FileManager`: Main container with toolbar and views
- `ContextMenu`: Right-click menu system
- `BulkOperationBar`: UI for multi-select actions
- `SyncStatusIndicator`: Real-time sync feedback

**Backend Requirements**
- Supabase functions for batch operations
- Queue system for vector store updates (Bull/BullMQ)
- Soft-delete implementation with `archived_at` timestamp
- File locking mechanism for concurrent edit prevention
- Audit trail table for all document operations

**Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Add to brain_bot_documents
ALTER TABLE brain_bot_documents ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE brain_bot_documents ADD COLUMN locked_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
ALTER TABLE brain_bot_documents ADD COLUMN locked_at TIMESTAMP;

-- New audit table
CREATE TABLE document_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  document_id UUID REFERENCES brain_bot_documents(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- create, update, move, delete, restore
  old_values JSONB,
  new_values JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### User Stories

1. **As a content manager**, I want to drag documents between folders so I can reorganize our knowledge base without using the Telegram bot.

2. **As a team lead**, I want to see who made changes to documents and when, so I can track content modifications.

3. **As a power user**, I want to select multiple documents and move them all at once, so I can efficiently reorganize large sections.

4. **As an editor**, I want to edit documents in-place and see changes reflected immediately in the brain-bot searches.

5. **As an admin**, I want to restore accidentally deleted documents from an archive, so mistakes aren't permanent.

#### Success Metrics
- Time to reorganize 50 documents reduced from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
- Zero data loss from user operations (soft delete only)
- Vector store sync completed within 30 seconds of edit
- Support for managing 10,000+ documents without performance degradation
- 90% of users prefer visual interface over Telegram commands for organization tasks

#### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Concurrent edits causing conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic locking and real-time collaboration indicators
  
- **Risk**: Vector store sync delays impacting search
  - **Mitigation**: Queue system with priority levels and batch processing
  
- **Risk**: Accidental bulk deletions
  - **Mitigation**: Archive system, undo functionality, and admin-only permanent delete

#### Future Enhancements
- Real-time collaboration (Google Docs-style)
- File upload from desktop (drag files into browser)
- Integration with external storage (S3, Google Drive)
- Advanced permissions per folder/document
- Workflow automation (approve/publish states)
- Desktop app using Tauri for native drag-and-drop from OS

*Note: This feature represents a significant evolution of BBUI from a viewer to a full document management system. It should be implemented in phases, starting with basic CRUD operations and gradually adding advanced features.*
